# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

# One build, one binary, ONE image.
#
# Every service and worker is a ROLE of the single `dub` binary
# (`dub --role device-attestation-api`; `dub --list-roles` prints the ten). There is one
# runtime stage, so there is one image: the deployment selects the role, the
# image does not. See docs/plans/active/one-image-one-binary.md.
#
# `ENTRYPOINT` with **no `CMD`** is deliberate. A container started with no
# arguments must fail loudly listing the accepted roles — never default into
# somebody else's service. That failure mode ("a mis-targeted build still
# starts, still passes /readyz, and serves the wrong thing") is what the old
# per-service image split existed to prevent, and it now lives in a values
# file instead of a build target: `scripts/verify_role_split.sh` asserts that
# every compose service and chart workload names a role the binary accepts, and
# that each role is named by exactly one of each.
#
# TLS is pure-Rust (ring + rustls), so no OpenSSL/system TLS libs are needed.
# Migrations are embedded at compile time (sqlx::migrate!), so the build needs
# the source tree but not a live database.

# ca-certificates is NOT optional: the chain-facing roles dial a wss:// RPC, and
# without the trust store that fails at runtime rather than at build time.
#
# There is deliberately no `curl`: the compose healthcheck runs
# `dub --healthcheck`, which GETs this container's own /readyz on the
# BIND_ADDR port. That removed the `runtime-http` base layer whose only purpose
# was carrying curl for six of the ten stages — so the workers did not gain a
# network client when the images merged. Kubernetes uses httpGet probes and
# needs nothing in the image either way.
