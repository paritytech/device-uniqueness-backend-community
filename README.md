A Rust backend that proves a device is a distinct physical device, and registers
a username for it on Polkadot's People Chain — plus the sibling services a
consumer app tends to need around that. It is a **reference blueprint**: fork it,
point it at whichever network you want, deploy it under whatever name you want.

## What it does

Eight services, each of which owns its Postgres database where it has one, and
each of which deploys independently behind a single-URL
[gateway](gateway/Caddyfile):

- **`device-attestation-api`** — the auth handshake (challenge → hardware
  attestation → JWT + refresh), username registration with free and paid lanes
  (`POST /api/v1/usernames`, availability, payment status, queue status), the
  attester key, JWKS, health. Verifies Apple App Attest and Android Play
  Integrity / key attestation.
- **`device-attestation-chain-writer`** — a single-instance worker that drains
  the reservation outbox onto the chain.
- **`registration-queue`** — a single-instance queue advancer; while
  `QUEUE_ENABLED` is on, it is the only path out of the registration queue.
- **`username-indexer`** — a finalized-chain username projection with public
  prefix search, plus an optional proof-of-compute gate on that search.
- **`invite-tickets-api`** / **`invite-tickets-pool`** — synchronous
  invitation-ticket claim, and the keypair pool that keeps it stocked.
- **`turn-api`** — a stateless TURN credential issuer (coturn REST API).
- **`notify-relay`** — a stateless APNs / FCM push relay.

Plus **`voucher-mint`**, an operator CLI for minting registration vouchers
(deliberately not an HTTP surface).

Registration can additionally claim a **dotNS** label on Asset Hub, as a second
independent state machine alongside the People Chain registration.

## What it does not do

- **It is not audited, and it is not a hardened production build.** See
  [Security](#security).
- **It does not run a chain.** It is a client of one, and it needs an attester
  account on that chain with an allowance and a funded signing proxy —
  prerequisites it cannot create for itself.
- **It does not issue personhood.** Device uniqueness is not proof of a person;
  it is one signal among several.
- **It does not ship a Kubernetes chart or any deployment automation.** Docker
  Compose is the configuration contract; port it wherever you like.

## One binary, eight roles

Every service and worker is a `--role` of the single `dub` binary. What makes a
container a given service is its role, not a different image:

```
dub --list-roles                       # the eight
dub --role device-attestation-api
```

## Quickstart

You need Docker with Buildx, and about ten minutes for the first compile.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paritytech/device-uniqueness-backend-community.git
cd device-uniqueness-backend-community
cp .env.example .env

docker network create dub-edge dub-metrics   # once per host
docker buildx bake all                       # one cargo build, one image
docker compose up -d                         # nothing is published — the edge does that
```

Nothing binds a host port by default. To reach a service directly, layer the
loopback-only debug overlay:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.debug.yml up -d
#   device-attestation 127.0.0.1:8080 · indexer :8081
#   invite-tickets :8083 · turn :8084 · notify :8085

curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8080/readyz
```

Or run a single role natively: `just run` / `just run-writer` / `just run-notify`,
with environment from `.env.example`.

### The network you are starting from

Out of the box `.env.example` points at **PreviewNet**
(`wss://previewnet.substrate.dev`), a public test network that is wiped and
re-spawned routinely, and uses the well-known development keys `//Alice` and
`//Bob`. That is enough for the stack to start and for the read paths to work.

For anything past that you need, on whichever network you target:

- an **attester account** with an attestation allowance,
- a **funded signing key** authorized as that account's `Any`/delay-0 proxy,
- for invites, an inviter account holding `AvailableInvites` quota.

Paseo's People Chain is
`wss://paseo-people-next-system-rpc.polkadot.io` — set
`DOTNS_GATEWAY_ENABLED=false` with it, because Paseo's Asset Hub runs a different
`reserve_name`.

[docs/operations.md](docs/operations.md) covers this from zero, including the
secret boundaries the compose file enforces and why they are worth keeping.

A live reference deployment of this code runs at
<https://identity.dotspark.app> ([API reference](https://identity.dotspark.app/docs)).
It exists so the API is explorable without deploying anything. It is a test
deployment operated by Parity on a test network — do not build against it, and do
not expect it to be there.

## Develop

```bash
just check                 # fmt + clippy + workspace tests + the config gates
just test-live-db          # deterministic Postgres suites; also required by CI
just test-live-chain       # optional Postgres + live People Chain smokes
just test-live-providers    # optional credentialed APNs / FCM smokes
just coverage-db           # canonical offline + Postgres coverage report
just deny                  # dependency licence and advisory audit
just openapi               # regenerate docs/api-reference after route/DTO changes
just routes                # regenerate the gateway route table
```

`just openapi` and `just routes` produce **committed generated artifacts** — a
test in `just check` fails if either is stale. Never hand-edit them.

## Releases

**This repository publishes binaries.** Releases are cut manually from a
`vX.Y.Z` tag via the [release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml). Each one
attaches:

- `dub-<version>-<target>.tar.gz` — the single `dub` binary for
  `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` and
  `aarch64-apple-darwin`;
- `dub-compose-<version>.tar.gz` — `docker-compose.yml`, `.env.example` and the
  gateway config, so the stack stands up on a host with no source tree;
- `SHA256SUMS`, covering every asset above.

**Verifying a tagged build.** Download `SHA256SUMS` alongside the assets and run
`sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS`. To satisfy yourself the binaries are this source,
build them yourself: `docker buildx bake all` compiles the very same
`Dockerfile` stage the release exports from.

### About the container image

There is a public image at `docker.io/paritytech/device-uniqueness-backend`, but
it is **not published from this repository** — Parity builds and pushes it from
its own working tree, and **its tags do not line up with this repository's
tags**. At the time of first publish it carries `v0.3.0`, built from source
older than this release. Treat it as a convenience, not as the artifact
corresponding to a tag here.

Because of that, the compose bundle does not blindly pin to it. The release
workflow checks whether an image exists at the release's exact tag and is
anonymously pullable; if it is, the bundle pins to it, and if it is not, the
bundle keeps its `build:` stanzas and the release notes say so. Either way the
bundle works — the second case just needs a source checkout beside it:

```bash
tar xzf dub-compose-<version>.tar.gz && cp .env.example .env
docker network create dub-edge dub-metrics
docker buildx bake all      # only if the bundle was not pinned to an image
docker compose up -d
```

Changes per release: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). **Pre-1.0, breaking changes
bump the minor** — `0.4.x` → `0.5.0` can break you.

## Security

Before deploying it for real use cases, you are responsible for:

- Reviewing the code yourself — we publish a reference, not a hardened
  production build
- Checking that the dependencies are up to date and free of known
  vulnerabilities
- Securing your own fork or deployment environment (keys, secrets, network
  configuration)
- Tracking the latest tagged release and commits for security fixes; older
  releases are not backported (exceptions might apply)

This code has **not been audited**. The defaults in `.env.example` are
development defaults — well-known dev keys, a public test network, permissive
toggles — and every one of them must be replaced before a deployment anyone else
can reach.
