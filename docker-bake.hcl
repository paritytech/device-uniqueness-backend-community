# Build graph for THE service image.

# One target, because there is one image: every service and worker is a role of
# the single `dub` binary it holds (`--role <name>`, selected by the compose
# `command:` / chart `args:`). This replaced ten targets that differed only in
# which binary they copied — see docs/plans/active/one-image-one-binary.md.
#

#   IMAGE_REPO=ghcr.io/paritytech/device-uniqueness-backend IMAGE_TAG=$(git rev-parse HEAD) \
#     docker buildx bake --push all
#
# `IMAGE_REPO` is a full repository path, not a registry: the tag is appended
# directly. Keeping it as one value is what lets a registry change be a variable
# change — `ghcr.io/paritytech/device-uniqueness-backend`,
# `docker.io/paritytech/device-uniqueness-backend`, or a GAR
# `<location>-docker.pkg.dev/<project>/<repo>/device-uniqueness-backend` all fit.
