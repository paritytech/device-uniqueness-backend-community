#!/usr/bin/env bash
# One image, eight roles — checked statically.
#
# This replaces verify_image_split.sh. That gate existed because a service whose
# build target pointed at another service's stage "still starts, still passes
# /readyz, and serves the wrong binary". Collapsing to one image does not remove
# that failure — it MOVES it, from a build target into a `--role` in a manifest.
# So the same invariant is asserted in its new location:
#
#   * every compose service names a role the binary accepts;
#   * every role is named by exactly ONE compose service;
#   * the service name IS the role, so a rename cannot half-land;
#   * every service runs the same image reference, tag included;
#   * the image has an ENTRYPOINT and no CMD, so a container with no args fails
#     loudly instead of defaulting into somebody else's service.
#
# The role list is sourced from the BINARY (`dub --list-roles`), never from a
# second hand-written list here, so this gate cannot disagree with what the
# process actually accepts.
#
# Offline: `bake --print` and `compose config` both resolve without building.
# The runtime half (the image holds exactly one binary, entrypoint and CMD are
# what the Dockerfile says) needs a built image and runs under RUNTIME_CHECK=1.
