-- Widevine device dedup records (PoUD Android device-uniqueness gate on
-- POST /api/v1/usernames). One row per pseudonymized physical device.
--
-- `device_hmac` is HMAC-SHA256(k, 'poud:v1' || deviceId), keyed by
-- WIDEVINE_DEDUP_HMAC_KEY; the raw device id is never stored. `reservation_id`
-- is set only while a claim is in flight, so a permanent row carries no
-- device->username link.
--
-- Lifecycle: PENDING is inserted in the same transaction as the username
-- reservation, becomes CONSUMED on on-chain success, and is DELETEd on
-- terminal failure so the device can claim again.
