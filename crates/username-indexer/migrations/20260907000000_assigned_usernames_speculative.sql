-- Speculative rows: indexed from the best (unfinalized) chain so a newly
-- registered username reaches search a finality trail earlier — measured at
-- 2–5 blocks on People, 5–14 on Asset Hub.
--
-- NULL means the row is confirmed: the finalized pass wrote it, and only the
-- finalized pass may change or remove it. Non-NULL records the best-block
-- number a speculative pass read the row at, and marks the row as the only
-- kind speculation is allowed to touch. That asymmetry is the whole safety
-- argument — speculation may add, and may retract what it added, but can never
-- delete or overwrite finalized state on the strength of a fork that may lose.
--
-- The column is also what makes a crash safe. A block seen at the tip is
-- discarded regularly (on PreviewNet's People chain, structurally, roughly one
-- height in eight), and a registration from a losing fork leaves no canonical
-- event for the finalized pass to ever touch that account again. Without a
-- durable mark, such a row would survive a restart forever.
